    <h2><strong>ABOUT THE RECIPE</h2></strong> 
    <p>Food historians aren’t entirely sure about the exact origins of Mexico’s most famous culinary export. In Jeffrey M. Pilcher’s book, Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food, he suggests that the dish might have become popular with 18th century silver miners, who named the handheld food after small explosive charges used to excavate ore. The dish grew in popularity through the growth of taquerias in Mexico City. When tacos became part of the fast-food landscape, Americans discovered a deep and abiding hunger for the meaty, crunchy, spicy food. One reason for the popularity of this beef taco recipe is that it calls for simple ingredients like ground beef, Old El Paso™ Thick 'n Chunky salsa and Old El Paso™ taco shells. You can customize the recipe with ground chicken or turkey.</p>
